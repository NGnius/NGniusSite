          Technologists is an online clan made for Robocraft players who want to find others like them.
          We enjoy playing and discussing Robocraft along with a diverse range of other games and subjects.
          The Technologists clan strives for a casual, fun environment.
          We try to ensure that everyone feels included, and that everyone has some fun every once in a while.
          Due to our small size we don't organize our own events, but we sometimes attend other events.
