        <p>
          I am an 18 year old Computer Engineering student who somehow still manages to have time to write About Me paragraphs and play video games on the Internet.
          I'm also interested in computer hardware and software, so I spend almost all of my free time around computers.
          That means that I'm a big nerd, in case you haven't guessed already.
          I, along with the help of a few others, maintain the Community Technical Help forum section for Robocraft.
          If you want help with a Robocraft issue, feel free to contact me, and I'll try to help!

          If you want more information about how wonderful I am, or just actually useful stuff, click the buttons.
          You know you want to click the buttons...
          It's like Cookie Clicker all over again, except with cooler animations, and less addictive.
          Who am I kidding, it's nothing like Cookie Clicker!?

                I am part of a few people who help with tech support for the community of Robocraft.
                It is completely voluntary, and I have no association with FreeJam, the developpers of Robocraft.
                I am often around on <a href="https://discord.gg/cyKTEH6">the Robocraft Moderators Discord server</a>, in case you want to contact me quickly, or stalk me :P

                I also am the leader of a small Robocraft clan. Nothing big, nothing fancy, but feel free to check us out at the link below:
