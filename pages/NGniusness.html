<p>A male who plays a lot of Robocraft, has his own website (for some odd reason) and enjoys technical stuff including coding and computer hardware. Also someone who tends to lurk or show up randomly on the Robocraft Community Technical Help forum section and someone who believes themselves rather good at being helpful there.</p>

<p><i>1. There once was a guy named NGnius, who thought his name very corny and witty. It was quite a pity, but then he chose a profile picture of a rather corny and witty named avatar. He then made some quite bad rhymes, of which none of them did make him any dimes. Which was quite fine, since the Canadian dollar was worth about an American dime. And that is the story of NGnius, who lived in an igloo and wasn't quite a genius.</i></p>
<p><i>2. NGnius the ruler of the Community Tech Support section! Mwahahahahahahahaha! </i></p><br>
